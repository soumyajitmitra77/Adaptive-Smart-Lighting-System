# Adaptive-Smart-Lighting-System

The project presents an adaptive smart lighting control system that utilizes sensor networks to track human movement in enclosed spaces. By dynamically adjusting light focus, intensity, and the number of lights, the system responds to the number of occupants in the room. Moreover, it intelligently adapts the light intensity based on the availability of natural light.

Components needed:
1. Arduino Uno Development Board
2. IR sensor
3. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
4. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
5. Relay
6. HC-05 Bluetooth module
